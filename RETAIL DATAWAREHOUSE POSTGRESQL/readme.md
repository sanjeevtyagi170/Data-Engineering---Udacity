# Project Description
A team of a retail company wants to get insights of their data like how many male & female customers are there, How many customers have returned etc.
Team has provided us the queries and data in csv files. Our task is to take these raw files into the postgre sql as well as implement the schema design. Run SQL queries to find the answer to queries.

Postgre SQL database has been created with the help of psycopg2 library and jupyter notebooks.
All operations like create, drop , select etc have been implemented with python.
On top of that **CSV** files have been imported directly to the SQL tables.
Below schema design has been implemented while importing the files.
